  <p>Every elementary feature in a software project requires code that lies somewhere
in a wide re-usability scale that goes
form extremely custom and strongly tied to the specific implementation
to completely generic and highly reusable.</p>
<p>On the <em>custom</em> side of the spectrum there is all the code that defines the
features of the software and all the choices of its implementation.
That one is code that need to be written.</p>
<p>On the other hand a seasoned software developer is trained to spot
pieces of functionality that lie far enough on the <em>generic</em> side of the range
that with high probability a library already implements it
<strong>and documents it well enough to be discovered with a keyword-based internet search</strong>.</p>
<p>In between the two extremes there is a huge gray area populated by pieces of functionality
that are not <em>generic</em> enough to obviously deserve a place in a library, but are
<em>common</em> enough that must have been already implemented by someone else for their
software. A huge trove of reusable code that is not actually reused.
This kind of code is doomed to be re-implemented again and again
for the simple reason that <strong>there is no way to search code by functionality</strong>...</p>
<p>Or is it?</p>
